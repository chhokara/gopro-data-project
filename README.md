# GoPro Telemetry Analysis

## Project Overview

This project implements a serverless data pipeline on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to extract and visualize telemetry (GPMF) data from GoPro videos. Raw .MP4 files are uploaded to Google Cloud Storage (GCS), where an Object Finalize event triggers a Cloud Composer (Airflow) DAG that launches a KubernetesPodOperator task running a custom container (built with gopro-telemetry) to parse GPS, accelerometer, and gyroscope streams. The processed outputs are stored in a curated GCS bucket as Parquet/JSON files, which are then loaded into BigQuery for querying and analysis. Finally, the telemetry is visualized in Grafana dashboards connected to BigQuery, enabling rich time-series analysis of speed, movement, and positioning data. The architecture is provisioned with Terraform and designed to be low-cost, scalable, and easily extensible with additional analytics or visualization layers in the future.
